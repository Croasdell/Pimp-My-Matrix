# Pimp My Matrix - a plugin for Craft

This plugin provides an alternative control for adding Matrix blocks that allows you to display block types in groups.

For details of how to use and install this plugin please see the [docs](http://plugins.supercooldesign.co.uk/plugin/pimp-my-matrix/docs).

## A note on block headings

Previously this plugin added the block type’s name to the title bar of each block, this is no longer necessary due to this feature being added in [Craft 2.3](http://buildwithcraft.com/updates#build2615).

If you haven’t upgraded Craft to 2.3 then we strongly suggest you do and please note that Matrix will look really weird if you don’t also upgrade this plugin to at least 1.3!
