# Pimp My Matrix - a plugin for [Craft](http://buildwithcraft.com)

This plugin provides an alternative control for adding Matrix blocks that allows you to display block types in groups.

Once grouped, you can customize the field layout for each block type.

You can also go one step further and override the default block type groups or field layouts for a specific context. The following contexts are currently supported:

- Entry Types
- Category Groups
- Global Sets
- Users

If you want to add your own context, perhaps for a custom element type, then there are hooks that let you do this - see the [hooks documentation](http://plugins.supercooldesign.co.uk/plugin/pimp-my-matrix/docs/hooks) for details.

## Quickstart

1. Copy the `pimpmymatrix/` folder to your `craft/plugins/` folder.
2. Go to Settings > Plugins from your Craft control panel and install the Pimp My Matrix plugin.
3. Click the “Pimp My Matrix” tab that will have now appeared as part of the main navigation.
4. Select a Matrix field and define your groups.
5. Click the gear icon on any block type to edit its field layout.

For further details of each specific context and advanced usage please see the [docs](http://plugins.supercooldesign.co.uk/plugin/pimp-my-matrix/docs).
