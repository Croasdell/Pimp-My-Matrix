# Usage

To create default block type groups and field layouts for all your Matrix fields click on the “Pimp My Matrix” tab in the main navigation. Here you will find a list of your current Matrix fields.

Click a field to launch the block type groups editor. It should look something like this:

![block type groups editor](http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/supercoolplugins/Pimp-My-Matrix/block-type-groups-editor.jpg)

Now you can group your block types in the same way that you create a field layout for a section:

![block type groups editor filled in](http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/supercoolplugins/Pimp-My-Matrix/block-type-groups-editor-2.jpg)

If you leave any block types off then they won’t be shown.

Once you have some groups you can go one step further and customize the field layout for a particular block - just click the gear icon and select ‘Edit field layout’.

![block type field layout](http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/supercoolplugins/Pimp-My-Matrix/block-type-field-layout-editor.jpg)

Thats it! You should now be able to browse to somewhere that uses that field and see your new groups and field layouts in action.
