This plugin enhances the default Matrix experience in two ways:

1. Adds the name of each block type to the top of the block.

2. Provides an alternative control for adding blocks that allows you to display block types in groups.

This plugin requires Craft 2.2 or greater.

## Settings

From the plugin settings page, you can configure the groupings you want for each block type in relation to each Matrix field. If you donâ€™t configure anything for a particular field it will be left alone.
