# Settings

From the plugin settings page, you can configure the groupings you want for each block type in relation to each Matrix field.

Use the table to create a list of groups and then use the select fields to match each block type with a group.

Things to note:
1. If you don’t configure anything for a particular field it will be left alone.
2. If you don’t select an option for a given block type then that block type will not appear in the ‘Add a block’ type menu.
3. All block types will still appear as usual (i.e. ungrouped) in the context menu in the block header.
