# Settings

From the plugin settings page, you can configure the groupings you want for each block type in relation to each Matrix field.

Things to note:
1. If you donâ€™t configure anything for a particular field it will be left alone.
2. If you don't select an option for a given blocktype then that blocktype will be excluded from the groups UI.
