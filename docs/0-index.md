# Installation

To install Pimp My Matrix, follow these steps:

1. Copy the `pimpmymatrix/` folder to your `craft/plugins/` folder.
2. Go to Settings > Plugins from your Craft control panel and install the Pimp My Matrix plugin.
3. Click the “Pimp My Matrix” tab that will have now appeared as part of the main navigation.


## Requirements

This plugin requires Craft 2.2 or greater and has only been tested on PHP versions 5.5 and 5.6.


## Upgrading

If you are upgrading from 1.x to 2.x your current configurations should be migrated for you - if you run into issues just uninstall the plugin before upgrading (you will have to re-define any groups you made).
